With my VR-Streamer server, my VR Streamer iOS app and correspronding vr googles you can simply dive into virtual reality. 
The VR-Streamer server serves you the possibillity to stream the image output of windows games (only in windowed mode) 
to your iphone. At the same time tracking data can be tranfered from iphone via UDP network connection to a 
head tracking application (like Opentack). Read for more informations on the official site.
